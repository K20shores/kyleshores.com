# It's been awhile

Much like many tech people that aspirationally start a blogging site before doing something new
with the intention of detailing their learning along the way, 
I haven't touched this site in years. This is partly because I often felt like I had nothing
to say about what I was learning, or I felt lazy, or staring at a computer again after classes
and research and homework was unappealing. Either way, I want to become better at communicating,
so I'm going to attempt to blog regularly-ish from now on. I'll start with my experience in graduate school.

I started my master's in January 2021 and graduated December 2023. Two years, which you would think should
feel short, but to me the time feels heavier than other periods of my life. I don't mean this in a bad way.
By the time I started my courses, I had already been talking with my advisor and working on a project. From that perspective,
my day to day felt almost normal. I replaced working in the day with research at night with research in the day, plus some learning.
I was thoroughly intent on packing my brain with useful information. I would spend about half of my day reading literally anything 
that I deemed important for graduate school. Some of the most memorable ones include

- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)
- [Geographic Data Science with Python](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html)
- [Writing Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13122323-writing-science)

Because I started in January 2021, my first graduate classes were entirely online. I met other graduate students
through some virtual hangouts,

I'm not going to talk about my [research](/research). While that took up most of my time in grad school,
there were many other aspects and lessons that are arguably more important.

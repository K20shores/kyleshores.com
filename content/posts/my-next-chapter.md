# A Bit About Me
I am about to change my life entirely and leave the world of software consulting to become a graduate
student in the Atmospheric Science department at Texas A&M. I'd like to share my journey into graduate school
and my reasoning for leaving stable employment.

## Education
Let's talk about my education! I started at Texas A&M in 2014 as a physics major. I was intent
on becoming an engineer, out of no ambition of my own. Many of my friends in high school had been
accepted into various engineering programs, so I thought that I should do the same thing.

As it turned out, I quite enjoyed physics. I guess there was an allure of describing the world with math.
It was like looking at the machinery of reality, as cheesy as that may sound. I enjoyed my classes, 
but I didn't really have a plan for my life, aside from becoming an engineer. 
So, I spent my freshman year looking at getting into engineering.

It turns out, the easiest way for me to get into engineering was to add a double degree. At the time,
all freshman engineers were in general engineering. In their second semester, they applied to different
disciplines, maybe had some interviews, and hoped to get in. I spent 15 minutes in the advisors office,
wrote three sentences on why I wanted to be an engineer and gave them my GPA and then I was in. 
Starting the summer after my freshman year, I had to take some introductory engineering courses

Throughout my first two semesters, I became involved in two science outreach programs organized
by Dr. Tatiana Erukhimova, one of the most influential scientists of my life. The first 
that I joined, Discover, Explore, Enjoy Physics and Engineering (DEEP) was all about making hands
on science demonstrations to be displayed and explained at the physics festival that Dr. Erukhimova
organizes each year at Texas A&M. It was there that I made my first connections with students who
were involved in undergraduate research. Being the impressionable young whatever age I was, 
that also became a thing I wanted to do. 

The second, and most fun program I joined, was what Dr. Tatiana, called physics shows. These shows
were about 45 minutes long and filled with fun demonstrations like the magnetic levitation, making
liquid oxygen, and many things with liquid nitrogen. I even frozen one of my finger nails for science (accidentally).
I have a permanently damaged nail, but it was entirely my fault.

Getting into research was pretty easy. I put my name on a list that the physics advisors keep of
students interested in doing research. Dr. McIntyre sent me an email and I met up with him. He 
agreed to take me on as an unpaid undergraduate researcher. I started in summer 2015. His is a high energy physics research lab.
I was working with a graduate student who was attempting to manufacture a superconductor out of BiSCO2212 that should have maintained
a better magnetic field at high voltages. I spent most of my days cleaning the equipment we used to make them. The image to the right
is what the ceramic looked like after it had undergone a heat treatment.

However, Dr. McIntyre had more than one research project. There was another which was about putting a particle collider
that would be neutrally buoyant in the Gulf of Mexico. The idea was quite ambitious. I think that any one part of the project
would have been an engineering marvel. My reservations aside, this project did introduce me to GIS systems and sparked my interest,
though I may not have realized it at the time, in earth science. I spent about an equal amount of time in those 6 months downloading
and visualizing ocean and wind currents, as well as ocean floor bathymetry. I was a pretty poor programmer. I even wrote a script
to plot some things that eventually made my computer run out of RAM. But, I enjoyed programming enough that I changed my electrical
engineering degree, to a computer science degree. I was now in a double degree program for physics and computer science.

Eventually my courses between computer science and physics had time collisions and I had to choose between the two. I dropped physics 
to a minor because I did not have any plans at that point to continue on in physics as a graduate student and I knew that computer science
was more marketable. I added mathematics as a minor shortly after that since I only needed one more math class to get a minor.

## Professional Career

When I was a freshman and sophomore in college I was extremely embarrassed about my resume. All of the activities and work experiences
I had were from high school. Granted, there wasn't much I could do about that my first semester of my freshman year. Yet by the time
I was a sophomore I still had not done much aside from the research and physics outreach to bolster my resume. This is not to discount
the work that I did in high schoool. A worked for a family friend on and off at his telecommunications company. A lot of it was physical
labor and I learned to appreciate blue collar work. I needed more relevant and recent experience.

In the Fall semester of my sophomore year, I took part in [TAMU HACK](https://tamuhack.com/). A 24 hour hackathon where you and several
hundred technophiles get together to "hack" something together. The project that I worked on that night ended up failing in the last few
hours because the hardware died. I ended up talking with some of the company representatives there and one of them told me to apply to 
a few co-op positions they had. Long story short, I ended up getting one of the positions.

This position offered work experience while in college, but in another state. I started working in what would have been the Fall semester of my junior year. 
I would have gone back every other semester, including the Summer sessions, to work for this company. I completed the first semester but ended up resigning
because some of my family members were having health issues and I felt the need to be in Texas where they were to spend more time with them.

This first company taught me work life balance. There was a strict 40 hour a week policy. Anything beyond that was heavily discouraged. At this point
in college I had been spending almost all of my free time studying. I studied even when I went home on the weekends. One spring break my family
took a ski trip and I even studied on the way up and down the mountain. Have a dedicated block of work forced me to try to spend time doing something
that was not work. Mostly for me that meant reading. However, the strict 40 hour a week policy was something that I learned to value and to this day
is one trait that I will always look for in a company.

On that note, if you work more than 40 hours a week and your job is essential (doctor, lawyer, peace officer, firefighter, etc.), do not think that
I am criticizing you for your very important work. It matters. No one dies if I only program 40 hours a week. I do hope that you find ample time for
yourself, though.

After resigning from the co-op, I applied to work at Lockheed Martin in the Spring of 2017. I worked there for the summer of 2017 in the cybersecurity
division. I did not know what I was applying for when I said that I was interested in working in cybersecurity. I spent that entire summer making
power point presentations about the fundamentals of cybersecurity. I did not really enjoy it, but I did learn quite a bit. Lockheed was a cubicle
farm from my perspective. They also emphasized working 40 hours, but I got the idea that this mostly applied to the interns and not the fulltime
people. Lockheed was not a good fit for me so I elected not to go back for another summer when they offered.

The week after I got back to college from working for Lockheed I started looking for jobs in College Station. I found a very small company with about
13 employees called Synchrogrid that was looking for a part time intern software developer. I applied and was accepted. The work was annoying at times,
but not because of management at the company and strictly because the tech stack that was needed to do what they wanted was limiting. I was honestly
very happy to be working there. The small number of employees was something I was initially worried about but grew to really enjoy. I spoke
with the CEO every single day. I essentially had 3 supervisors, the CEO, a consulting friend of the CEOs, and one of the other full time employees.
They were all a joy to work with. The consulting friend of the CEO was one of people kind enough to write a letter of recommendation for me. Here, 
I learned that I preferred small companies over large ones.

I worked at Synchrogrid for a full year and quit at the beginning of the Fall semester of my last semester in college. For the last 6 months
of my employment at Synchrogrid I had been applying to various companies to get a full time job after I graduated. There is a wonderful medium-sized
software consulting company in College Station called Capsher Technology. When I went on the interview, I felt very welcome. The atmosphere was 
very friendly, GlassDoor listed them as having between 50-100 employees, and they emphasized a 40 hour work week. I was very happy to receive an offer
of employment from Capsher.

Working at Capsher is and really enjoyable. I learned how to more effetively function on an actual software team. White board communication is heavily
pushed at Capsher so my diagramming skills were sharpened. Explaining the issues I was facing clealry was a skill I had to learn, but I did it. At the
same time that I was learning to be an effective employee, I discovered the idea of financial independence, or FI. A large chunk of my free time in my
first year was spent learning about personal finance, how to invest, what retirement at age 35 or 40 (yes, really, it's simple math) would look like.


# Motivation for Graduate School

One of the principles of FI is living happily within your means. In particular, some members of the FI community emphasize ideas of stoicism and minimalism. This really
resonated. I became quite a bit more introspective and started to ask myself what made me happy. In the beginning this introspection was a driving force
for decding what to spend on. After a few months, my spending stabilized (thankfully to a lower point than when I started, increasing my savings rate),
and my happiness dramatically increased. There were evenings when I'd be reading a book, drinking a fine (cheap) glass of wine that I would suddenly
think "I couldn't possibly be more happy than I am right now", and it was true. I didn't want for more.

Now, my happiness outside of work was real. Once my financial life was in order I stopped reading about finances and the economy as heavily as I had
been. When I was in college I learned about the basics of radiative transfer, the process that determines earth's energy budget and is how we 
know that the earth is warming. I was really interested in that and I started to learn more about climate change, mostly through podcasts. 


This was fun, but also scary. The problems posed by climate change are immense. They are happening now. They are going to take a great deal of 
effort to solve. Fortunatley, we know exactly what the problem is (too much carbon being released which accumulates and increases the 
strength of the green house effect, warming the earth) so we also know what the solution is (stop releasing carbon, you bunch of idiots). 

The more climate change occupied my mind, the more I became dissatissfied with my job. You see, what I worked on was not helping
to fight climate change and that did not jive with my morals. Don't take this to mean that Capsher is a bad company. By all means, Capsher's moral values quite strongly align with mine,
but the contracts that they had did not offer the kinds of work that were fulfilling to me. I began to look for jobs that I could go to that needed my programming skills and 
would contribute to climate change mitigation or adaptation. I found a few companies and applied. None got back to me. Even if they had, most were
in a different state or country and I wasn't really prepared to leave Texas just yet. 

So, in March of 2020 I emailed Dr. Erukhimova to ask for her advice on how I might
get into graduate school for atmospheric science. She pointed me to Dr. Gerald North,
who then put me into contact with Dr. Yangyang Xu. Dr. Xu took an immediate interest
in me and over the summer of 2020 worked with me on an air quality machine learning model
so that we could each see if we would be a good fit to study together. The relationship
was appreaciated on both sides. Dr. Xu guided me through the admission process.

When my application was being reviewd by the admissions committee, Dr. Ping Yang also
took an interest in me. Dr. Xu and him agreed to be my co-advisors and start in January, 2021, 
I will be a graduate research assitant at Texas A&M University pursing a masters in
atmospheric science!

# A Bit About Me
I am about to change my life entirely and leave the world of software consulting to become a graduate
student in the Atmospheric Science department at Texas A&M. I'd like to share my journey into graduate school
and my reasoning for leaving stable employment.

## Education
Let's talk about my education! I started at Texas A&M in 2014 as a physics major. I was intent
on becoming an engineer, out of no ambition of my own. Many of my friends in high school had been
accepted into various engineering programs, so I thought that I should do the same thing.

As it turned out, I quite enjoyed physics. I guess there was an allure of describing the world with math.
It was like looking at the machinery of reality, as cheesy as that may sound. I enjoyed my classes, 
but I didn't really have a plan for my life, aside from becoming an engineer. 
So, I spent my freshman year looking at getting into engineering.

It turns out, the easiest way for me to get into engineering was to add a double degree. At the time,
all freshman engineers were in general engineering. In their second semester, they applied to different
disciplines, maybe had some interviews, and hoped to get in. I spent 15 minutes in the advisors office,
wrote three sentences on why I wanted to be an engineer and gave them my GPA and then I was in. 
Starting the summer after my freshman year, I had to take some introductory engineering courses

Throughout my first two semesters, I became involved in two science outreach programs organized
by Dr. Tatiana Erukhimova, one of the most influential scientists of my life. The first 
that I joined, Discover, Explore, Enjoy Physics and Engineering (DEEP) was all about making hands
on science demonstrations to be displayed and explained at the physics festival that Dr. Erukhimova
organizes each year at Texas A&M. It was there that I made my first connections with students who
were involved in undergraduate research. Being the impressionable young whatever age I was, 
that also became a thing I wanted to do. 

The second, and most fun program I joined, was what Dr. Tatiana, called physics shows. These shows
were about 45 minutes long and filled with fun demonstrations like the magnetic levitation, making
liquid oxygen, and many things with liquid nitrogen. I even frozen one of my finger nails for science (accidentally).
I have a permanently damaged nail, but it was entirely my fault.

Getting into research was pretty easy. I put my name on a list that the physics advisors keep of
students interested in doing research. Dr. McIntyre sent me an email and I met up with him. He 
agreed to take me on as an unpaid undergraduate researcher. I started in summer 2015. His is a high energy physics research lab.
I was working with a graduate student who was attempting to manufacture a superconductor out of BiSCO2212 that should have maintained
a better magnetic field at high voltages. I spent most of my days cleaning the equipment we used to make them. The image to the right
is what the ceramic looked like after it had undergone a heat treatment.

However, Dr. McIntyre had more than one research project. There was another which was about putting a particle collider
that would be neutrally buoyant in the Gulf of Mexico. The idea was quite ambitious. I think that any one part of the project
would have been an engineering marvel. My reservations aside, this project did introduce me to GIS systems and sparked my interest,
though I may not have realized it at the time, in earth science. I spent about an equal amount of time in those 6 months downloading
and visualizing ocean and wind currents, as well as ocean floor bathymetry. I was a pretty poor programmer. I even wrote a script
to plot some things that eventually made my computer run out of RAM. But, I enjoyed programming enough that I changed my electrical
engineering degree, to a computer science degreee. I was now in a double degree program for physics and computer science.

Eventually my courses between computer science and physics had time collisions and I had to choose between the two. I dropped physics 
to a minor because I did not have any plans at that point to continue on in physics as a graduate student and I knew that computer science
was more marketable. I added mathematics as a minor shortly after that since I only needed one more math class to get a minor.

## Professional Career

When I was a freshman and sophmore in college I was extremely embarrassed about my resume. All of the activities and work experiences
I had were from highschool. Granted, there wasn't much I could do about that my first semester of my freshman year. Yet by the time
I was a sophomore I still had not done much aside from the research and physics outreach to bolster my resume. This is not to discount
the work that I did in highschoool. A worked for a family friend on and off at his telecommunications company. A lot of it was physical
labor and I learned to appreciate blue collar work. I needed more relevant and recent experience.

In the Fall semester of my sophomore year, I took part in [TAMU HACK](https://tamuhack.com/). A 24 hour hackathon where you and several
hundred technophiles get together to "hack" something together. The project that I worked on that night ended up failing in the last few
hours because the hardware died. I ended up talking with some of the company representatives there and one of them told me to apply to 
a few co-op positions they had. Long story short, I ended up getting one of the positions.

This position offered work experience while in college, but in another state. I started working in what would have been the Fall semester of my junior year. 
I would have gone back every other semester, including the Summer sessions, to work for this company. I completed the first semester but ended up resiging
because some of my family members were having health issues and I felt the need to be in Texas where they were to spend more time with them.

This first company taught me work life balance. There was a strict 40 hour a week policy. Anything beyond that was heavily discouraged. At this point
in college I had been spending almost all of my free time studying. I studided even when I went home on the weekends. One spring break my family
took a ski trip and I even studied on the way up and down the mountain. Have a dedicated block of work forced me to try to spend time doing something
that was not work. Mostly for me that meant reading. However, the strict 40 hour a week policy was something that I learned to value and to this day
is one trait that I will always look for in a company.

On that note, if you work more than 40 hours a week and your job is essential (doctor, lawyer, peace officer, firefighter, etc.), do not think that
I am critisizing you for your very important work. It matters. No one dies if I only prorgram 40 hours a week. I do hope that you find ample time for
yourself, though.

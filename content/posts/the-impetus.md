# Changing Directions
I belive that as often as possible we must make fully informed decisions about nearly everything in our lives. Since starting college, I can point to 6 life choices which heavily influenced my personality, my happiness, and my personal and professional goals. I'll be talking about those here.

I'll start near the beginning of college and walk through my lone experience in research, my co-cops and internships, how dance affected my life, and finally how my current employment affected my decision to apply to graduate school.
I graudated highschool in 2014 and started as an undegraduate at Texas A&M pursuing a BS in physics.

# Undergraduate Research
My first semester of college was difficult for me. It took me awhile to adjust to being away from my friends and family. I probably went home a little too often which made making friends and getting used to being away all that much harder. I didn't really connect to my roommates all that much; we were in to different hobbies. I was, hover, incredibly devoted to my studies and doing quite well in them. When my physics professor, Dr. Tatiana, talked about an opportunity to join a program called DEEP (Discover, Explore, Enjoy Physics and Engineering), I jumped on it.

DEEP is a graduate student lead collection of teams devoted to scientific communication at Texas A&M. Each summer, Dr. Tatiana organizes a physics festivalâ€”a day full of scientific communication and hands-on demonstrations. I was attempting to do a demo on [Schlieren optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieren_photography).

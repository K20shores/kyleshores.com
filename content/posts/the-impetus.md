# A Bit About Me
Good morning! I realize that it may not be morning when you read this, but morning is my favorite time of day!
That's when I feel most peaceful and I'm going to pretend that I'm talking to you when I feel most happy.

I am about to change my life entirely and leave the world of software consulting to become a graduate
student in the Atmospheric Science department at Texas A&M. This post is going to outline my path into graduate school. This blog in general wioll detail my experiences as I go through graduate school. 

Leaving the workforce to attend graduate school is not something that anyone should do lightly, 
and I've certainly place a good deal of thought into it. I am going to explain a little about myself,
my personality, and my experiences. My decision to change the path of my life is calculated. It's
not something done on a whim. I will walk you through my college experience, my (brief) 
professional&mdash;a word I'm not sure can be applied to me&mdash;career in software development, 
and how my personal philosophy lead me to ultimately uppend my life and rip stability out from under me.

# Those Crucial College Years
My first semester of college was difficult for me. It took me awhile to adjust to being away from my friends and family. I probably went home a little too often which made making friends and getting used to being away all that much harder. I didn't really connect to my roommates all that much; we were in to different hobbies. I was, hover, incredibly devoted to my studies and doing quite well in them. When my physics professor, Dr. Tatiana, talked about an opportunity to join a program called DEEP (Discover, Explore, Enjoy Physics and Engineering), I jumped on it.

DEEP is a graduate student lead collection of teams devoted to scientific communication at Texas A&M. Each summer, Dr. Tatiana organizes a physics festivalâ€”a day full of scientific communication and hands-on demonstrations. I was attempting to do a demo on [Schlieren optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlieren_photography).

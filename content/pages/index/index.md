# Howdy!

## I am a software developer and graduate student!

I develop software for [NCAR](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) in the [ACOM](https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/) division. I work on improving the code quality of
various chemical models alongside many other wonderful software engineers and intelligent scientists.

I've been a graduate student at Texas A&M pursuing a Master's in Atmospheric Science since January 2021. I study the application of machine learning to estimate
air quality with satellite data under my advisors [Dr. Yangyang Xu](https://yangyangxu.weebly.com/) and [Dr. Ping Yang](https://atmo.tamu.edu/people/profiles/faculty/yangping.html).

After graduating with my bachelors in computer science in 2018, I joined [Capsher](https://capsher.com/) as a software developer. My development and professional skills grew 
in my time there. I was extremely happy with my job and thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with. However, my passion for climate science
drove me to purse a Master's in Atmospheric Science so that I could contribute to positive, equitable climate mitigation and adaptation solutions. My work
at NCAR supports scientists who do just that.

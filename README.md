- The academic icons are from the collection made by [James Walsh](https://github.com/jpswalsh) downloaded from his [website](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/)
- SVG icon files were created with [this tool](https://fontastic.me/). Which I learned from this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42296853/5217293). Then I put them into the Social container because thtat's the only way I found safari would explain everything.
 - I modeled the burger menu off of [this article](https://css-tricks.com/hamburger-menu-with-a-side-of-react-hooks-and-styled-components/)

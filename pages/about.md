# Howdy!

I'm a software developer, cat dad, and a nerd. Welcome! Feel free to check out my blog and leave any thoughts you have.

I suck at communicating, so this site is a way for me to hopefully get better by actually blogging.

I've had this for awhile, but have mostly focused on the code of the site, which helps no one. In the past, I used [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to create everything, but honestly that was *way* more
complex than anything I needed. A static site created with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) deployed on
top of [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) covers everything I need. So, I can focus less on something that no one sees and more on something that people may actually read.

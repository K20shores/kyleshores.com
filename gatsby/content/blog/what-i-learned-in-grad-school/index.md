# It's been awhile

Much like many tech people that aspirationally start a blogging site before doing something new
with the intention of detailing their learning along the way, 
I haven't touched this site in years. This is partly because I often felt like I had nothing
to say about what I was learning, or I felt lazy, or staring at a computer again after classes
and research and homework was unappealing. Either way, I suck at communicating and want to be better
so I'm going to attempt to blog regularly-ish from now on. I'll start with my experience in graduate school.

# Year 1
I'd like to talk about what I learned in graduate school. I'm not going to talk about my 
[research](/research). While that took up most of my time,
there were many other aspects and lessons that are arguably more important. 

I started my master's in January 2021 and graduated December 2023. Two years, which you would think should
feel short, but to me the time feels heavier than other periods of my life. I don't mean this in a bad way.
By the time I started my courses, I had already been talking with my advisor and working on a project. From that perspective,
my day to day felt almost normal. I replaced working in the day with research at night with research in the day, plus some learning.
I was thoroughly intent on packing my brain with useful information. I would spend about half of my day reading literally anything 
that I deemed important for graduate school. Some of the most memorable ones include

- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)
- [Geographic Data Science with Python](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html)
- [Writing Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13122323-writing-science)

Because I started in January 2021, my first graduate classes were entirely online. I met other graduate students
through some virtual hangouts, but most of my interactions were with my advisor. We met about once a week and I would talk
about what I learned that week and any research I may have gotten done. I thoroughly enjoyed these first 6 months. It was full of
learning, relatively easy yet quite interesting classes, and just general contentedness. In hindsight I think this
period was so pleasant because it was enitrely different than my previous year. And, since this occurred almost a year into
the pandemic, I think it helped prevent me from feeling stir crazy because everything was new.

## The largest impact
I was very, very fortunate to be a part of a program where every single student is funded in some way through the department. This could 
be through grants your advisor has (me), grants that you have, or by being a TA. Because this is a paid position, I was technically
a Texas A&M employee which gave me access to some of their employee development programs. Sometime in my first semester, A&M paid
for a meditation teacher to give a six week course. This, by far, was the most impactful activity I engaged in for my two years.

My life has always been stable. This is a large privilege that I have and I recognize that not everyone has this. However, there are
still some things that have been hard for me to deal with, and mostly I dealt with them by ignoring them, or just feeling angry. Mindfulness
gave me the tools to be with my emotions. That, apparently, is incredibly powerful and allowed me to feel a deeper sense of peace. 

Yeah, sure, it's another white dude discovering mindfulness for himself. True. But it works for me.

## Ok but now everything is in person
I don't actually remember much about that first summer. I think I mostly did research stuff. I got far enough that I was able
to apply to present in the MAP-AQ section of the [2021 IGAC conference](https://igacproject.org/activities/map-aq). Look
[my name was on the scheulde](https://igacproject.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/IGAC-MAP-AQ%20Program_rajesh.pdf). So I 
guess that was cool. 

However, it was also at this point that I began to feel lose my confidence. You see, as you do research, you mostly learn
that you don't really know anything. I was reading about 2-3 academic papers per week for this entire first year. Some of them
were very approachabe, but others were incredibly involved and made me question if any of the work I was doing was right. It didn't
help that I hadn't actually started my core classes until Fall of 2021, and at this point I had already done about half of my research.
That felt backwards.

And then classes started. In person. At which point I met my cohort, 9 other individuals who were just as dewey-eyed
as I was 6 months ago. I had an edge of cynacism and arrogance, becasuse mindfulness had only done so much to lower
my ego at this point. This, on top of my inclination towards heavy introversion, meant that I started to feel uncomfortable 
with my new day-to-day routine. Go to campus, maybe do some research (fortunately my advisor let me do essentially only
class for this semester), do some class stuff, and then do much homework and studying. 

The IGAC conference occurred just a few weeks after the semester started. On top of that, I was beginning to struggle
a bit in my classes. In fact, my first grade in my dynamics class was like a 52 or something. Super fun. At the IGAC conference
I learned just how much cooler the work was that everyone in my field seemed to be. 

So, my confidence got thinner. On top of that, I had volunteered to be the outreach coordinator for the graduate students, attempting
to provide science outreach opportunities. Also, I volunteered to be a graduate mentor in the [2021-2022 DEEP Program](https://physics.tamu.edu/outreach/deep/).
I thought I could come up with neat demos to explain climate change. Turns out that I couldn't and I was only able to think of
trying to build a climate change dashboard alongside other things to augment the explanations. I couldn't think of the other things.

That truly sucked and was embarrassing to me. I think this was something that made me spread myself too thin and knocked my confidence
down. Estimating my abilities accurately had been easy to do in terms of things like programming, dancing, and music making, but not 
in science communication. So I learned what I wasn't ready for at this time.

However, I feel like I excelled as an outreach chair. Along with my cochair, I helped setup a blood drive, a food drive, 
and even organized a day at a local middle school. Both
were waaaay more work than I realized they would be, but we got them done. This was defintely the difference between me trying to do
everything as the graduate mentor for DEEP and doing stuff together with my outreach and volunteers. Yay teamwork.
